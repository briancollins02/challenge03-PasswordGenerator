# Password Generator

## Description

This webpage hosts a simple and easy to use password generator, allowing parameters such as length and the presence of lower-case, upper-case, numbers, and special characters to be present.
This project was done as practice for javascript basics, and to better handle running functions and handling multiple variables. 
While this website doesn't offer too much in the digital landscape of today, with google and apple having built in password generation and management, it holds value in the code that built the program.
I learned how to save yourself a lot of work by putting in the planning initially and found that once a solution was found on paper, the code came out quicker and more efficient.
